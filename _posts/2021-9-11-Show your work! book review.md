## Summary

This book is after author's another book "Steal like an artist", which talks about how to steal from others. Instead, it talks about how to influence others by letting them steal from you.

## The book in 3 sentences

1. You don't have to be a genius for sharing, unless you switch the mind about what's the point of sharing.
2. Sharing make you findable，and clue you with those who share your obsessions.
3. Before being an interesting person, be interested.

## Some impressive points

Why do we need sharing?

> By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can then leverage when they need it-for fellowship, feedback, or patronage.

> Creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds.

> Being a valuable part of a scenius is not necessarily about how smart or talent you are, but about what you have to contribute-the ideas you share. If we forget about genius and think more about how we can nurture and contribute to a scenius, we can adjust our own expectations and the expectations of the worlds we want to accept us. We can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others.

> The problem with hoarding is you end up living off your reserves. Eventually, you'll become state. If you give away everything you have, you are left with nothing. This forces you to look, to be aware, to replenish... Somehow the more you give away, the more comes back to you.

About documentation:

> Whether you share it or not, documenting and recording your process as you go along has its own rewards: You'll start to see the work you're doing more clearly and feel like you're making progress. And when you're ready to share, you'll have a surplus of material to choose from.

Why stories matters?

> Stories are such a powerful driver of emotional value that their effect on any given object's subjective value can actually be measured objectively.

> Personal stories can make the complex more tangible, spark associations, and offer entry into things that might otherwise leave one cold.

About being interesting:

> To be "interest-ing" is to be curious and attentive, and to practice "the continual projection of interest." To put it more simply: if you want to be interesting, you have to be interested.

> Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you'll attract people who love that kind of stuff.
